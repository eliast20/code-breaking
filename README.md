Mastermind is a classic two-player code-breaking game. The game is played with a code maker and a code breaker. The code maker which is the computer in this case creates a secret code by selecting a sequence of colored pegs and the code breaker has to guess the code within a certain number of attempts. The code maker provides feedback after each attempt, indicating how many pegs are placed correctly in both color and position and how many are of the correct color but in the wrong position. The code breaker then uses this information to make a better guess in the next attempt until they successfully guess the code or they run out of attempts. The game is won by the code breaker if they successfully guess the code within the allowed attempts and is won by the code maker if the code breaker is unable to guess the code within the allowed attempts.
